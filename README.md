Python is an interpreted language. 🙀

Python is an object oriented language, every piece of data in the program is an Object. 👍

A single Python object can have multiple references (alias).

A variable is a reference to an object.

Basic immutable data types: int, float, bool, str, None.

Composite data types: tuple (immutable), list, set, dict.
