# Exam project

The goal of this project is to build a data science pipeline that predicts for each event, given as inputs the characteristics of the signals measured by each pad, the target (x,y) coordinates where the particle of interest passed.

### Run locally with Jupyter Notebook
Make sure you have python3 and pip installed. Then run the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
ipython kernel install --user --name=venv  # To enable the venv kernel on jupyter
jupyter notebook  # Select the venv kernel
```


## Algorithm scores

Machine: Macbook Pro M1 PRO 10 cores 16GB RAM

Avarege CPU temperature during training: 95Â°C

RAM used by the python kernel: 2.7GB

R2 score is a metric for regression problems. Closer to 1 is better.

Euclidean score is the metric that will be used to evaluate the submission. (This function is defined by the assignment)
